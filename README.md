Compare octane rating/fuel blends/functional groups as dimensions for ignition delay model training

Example code used for my research. In this repo, I take an IDT dataset that has octane rating as input features and convert the RON/MON values to the fuel blend ratios and then convert the fuel blend ratios to ratios of methyl, methylene, and benzyl-type functional groups as the physical properties for the fuel blends. I take the resulting datasets and train random forest and neural networks and compare results through stats and graphing.
